CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS

Project Objective : Telecom Industry Churn Analysis
 The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn in the telecom industry and
 provide actionable insights to reduce attrition. Customer churn, which refers to the
 percentage of customers who leave a service over a given period, is a critical metric for
 businesses, especially in competitive markets like telecommunications. This project
 aims to identify the factors that contribute to customer churn and develop strategies to
 enhance customer retention.

Problem Statement:
 The churn rate is 27% in this telecom company, which makes it a tremendous loss in
 revenue. Identifying the need and requirement for why a customer was churned is
 extremely important for the company so that it can improve retention and ultimately
 satisfy the customer. Therefore, in this project, we try to analyze the churn patterns
 across different customer segments based on demographic information, geography,
 payment methods, contract types, and service usage for revealing significant drivers of
 churn.

 Project Target:
 Create an entire ETL process in a database & a Power BI dashboard to utilize the
 Customer Data and achieve below goals:
 ● Visualize & Analyze Customer Data at below levels
